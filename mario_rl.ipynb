    "## 1. Introduction & Objectives\n",
    "Our project aims to maximise World 1.1 completion rate in Super Mario Bros by training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Mario agent. Mario’s task is learning how to make the optimal moves to reach the flag by navigating through or evading various obstacles such as enemies, holes, and pipes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, reinforcement learning algorithms can be computationally demanding and their efficiency is significantly influenced by the choice of hyperparameters, the reinforcement learning algorithm’s complexity, and data pre-processing. Therefore, finding the best combination of these factors can lead to more time and computation-sparing learning and improved performance of the model. From the numerous RL methods available, we chose to focus on two methods, double-deep Q learning (DDQL) and proximal policy optimisation (PPO), which are value [11] and policy-based [12] RL algorithms respectively."

    "##### <b>EMULATOR ENVIRONMENT<b>:\n",
    "- ``gym`` is a [toolkit](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/index.html) by OpenAI designed for testing different reinforcement learning algorithms in different gaming environments (e.g. ATARI or NES). \n",
    "- ``gym.spaces.Box`` provides a continue observation space for our Mario.\n",
    "- ``gym.wrappers.FrameStack`` aids in providing a temporal element to training, where multiple observations are stacks so that historical information of Mario's position can contribute to learning. Find documentation on wrappers [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/api/wrappers/).\n",
    "- ``gym_super_mario_bros`` supplies the Super Mario Bros environment (from which we can specify worlds, levels & visualisation settings)\n",
    "- ``nes_py.wrappers.JoypadSpace`` from [nes-py](https://pypi.org/project/nes-py/) allows for the mapping of joystick and button actions to a discrete action space. In this investigation, we simplify the action space to just right and up+right movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <b>NEURAL NETWORKS<b>:\n",
    "- ``torch.nn`` and ``torch.nn.functional`` are methods and collections of functions that are used to create deep neural networks (such as the CNN architecture we create in the DDQL section) and perform tensor manipulation respectively.\n",
    "- ``tensordict.TensorDict`` allows us to handle dictionaries within PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "- ``TensorDictReplayBuffer`` and ``LazyMemmapStorage`` from ``torchrl.data``: used to cache and load tensor replays from within training epochs."

    "\n",
    "We implemented our models within an OpenAI Gym Environment using a virtual NES emulator, then using a library called super-mario-bros-gym to manipulate the original NES environment. This library allows us to simplify our action space, so the agent can only choose from going forward and jumping. Subsequently, we simplified the environment (as seen in Figure 1) to boost the computational efficiency of the strenuous training process, removing redundancies in background and object details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because each state is represented by a ``[3, 240, 256]`` dimensional matrix, we need to downsample and downscale the environment so that the model can be trained as swiftly as possible. For instance, we don't care about the details of the Mario agent, thus, we can reduce him to just a dynamic rectangle moving in an undetailed grayscale world. We used Wrapper classes with the help of ``gym.wrappers`` to achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ``GrayScaled`` eliminates unnecessary color channels, such that we reduce dimensionality from ``[3, 240, 256]`` to ``[1, 240, 256]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ``ResizeFrames`` to downsample each observation state into a square image: ``[1, 84, 84]``\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ``FrameSkipper`` to skip n-intermediate frames as not every frame contains unique, valuable, information. In order to not lose reward information, we aggregate the rewards accumulated in the otherwise skipped frame into the returned n-th frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ``FrameStack`` to condense multiple frames into a single observation, creating a temporal element to training. We can now recall Mario's actions in the previous several frames. Therefore, the final environment shape is ``[n, 84, 84]`` where n = the size of each frame stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these classes and methods are used within a convenient ``create_environment`` function that takes the world, level, skip, stack and action space as input params). \n"

    "In the literature, Klein [14] shows that after training for 5000 iterations (that is, until Mario died or reached the end of the level), an agent was able to win about 90% of the time. We used his discount factor of 0.6, learning rate of 0.8 and epsilon-greedy upper bound of 0.3 as inspiration for our hyperparameter tuning. In this project, however, we focus on maximising the rewards obtained by the model while minimising the training time as each team member only had access to a CPU.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimising training time enhances its versatility and transferability, making it potentially applicable to other similar tasks or environments. From their superior results within the literature as well as their widespread use in the context of ATARI and NES games emulated for RL tasks, we employed Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "[The DDQN algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461) introduces a mechanism that employs two separate networks: the online network and the target network. The online network learns and updates the Q-values, while the target network, a delayed copy of the online network, provides stable Q-value targets ($Q_{online}$ vs $Q_{target}$). This is to promote symmetrical learning (contrary to the greedy overestimation bias present in regular DQN). This decoupling of action selection and action evaluation helps reduce over-optimistic value estimates, leading to more accurate Q-values and better policies. For DDQL, we implemented a CNN architecture and agent class that explores and exploits the action space, and stores and recalls previous states. DDQL is particularly appropriate for training Mario because of its non-stationary nature, where the delayed updating of the target network reduces variation and overestimation in Q-value predictions, thereby resulting in higher stability and likelihood for faster convergence. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}{TD}_e = Q_{online}^*(s,a)\\end{align} <br>\n",
    "\\begin{align}a' = argmax_{a} Q_{online}(s', a)\\end{align} <br>\n",
    "\\begin{align}{TD}_t = r + \\gamma Q_{target}^*(s',a')\\end{align} <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Q^*$ is the optimal value under an optimal policy, TD<sub>e</sub> is the temporal difference estimation and TD<sub>t</sub> is the temporal different target value. DDQL is a form of TD learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we sample from Mario's replay buffer, the online network is updated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\\theta_{online} \\leftarrow \\theta_{online} + \\alpha \\nabla(TD_e - TD_t)\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastingly, the target network doesn't undergo backpropagation, so it is updated as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\\theta_{target} \\leftarrow \\theta_{online}\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where θ<sub>online</sub> and θ<sub>target</sub> are the neural network parameters for the online and offline networks respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf) is an optimization method that seeks to improve the policy while ensuring that the new policy doesn’t deviate drastically from the old one. What makes PPO different to DDQN and other value function methods is the use of an 'advantage function' that attempts to gauge how much 'better' or 'worse' an action is relative to the expected value. PPO maintains stability by adding a constraint to the ‘surrogate objective function’ (SOF), which penalises changes in the policy that are too large. This approach is crucial for achieving optimal results, especially if the old policy was near-optimal. As such, the negative consequences of stochasticity and complexity in the Mario environment can be mitigated through the stability provided by the SOF. PPO excels in processing high-dimensional inputs, which is a feature highly pertinent to managing the multi-dimensional pixel and temporal tensors required for training our Mario agent. In the context of Mario RL Learning, a 'bad' action means detrimental consequences (i.e., Mario's death), thus we want to minimise bias while simultaneously reducing variance between estimates.<br>\n",
    "This is a high level description of what the stable-baselines-3 PPO method does:\n",
    "1. The current policy is executed to collect 'trajectories', which is a set of action, state, reward tuples.\n",
    "2. Advantages (A) are computed using the generalised advantage estimation function (GAE).\n",
    "3. The value functions are updated using mean squared error calculations via backpropagation after a forward pass through a CNN.\n",
    "4. Policy gradients ∇θ are computed on the objective function J(θ) using advantage estimates (A). \n",
    "5. The policy parameters are updated by selecting the action that increases the expected value (via argmax).\n",
    "\n",
    "We manipulated the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "- TAU: the trade-off hyperparameter responsible for modulating variance and bias in the advantage function. High TAU means low bias and high variance (and vice versa).\n",
    "- BETA = the coefficient to the entropy function H(Pi), where a larger beta means higher entropy and thus a reduction in deterministic tendencies.\n",
    "- CLIPPING EPSILON = controls the extent of clipping to prevent training destabilisation as a result of significant policy changes. This occurs in the 'surrogate objective function' where the new and old policies are compared and replaced.\n",
    "- NUM GLOBAL STEPS = total number of steps across all parallel instances.\n",
    "- NUM PARALLEL PROCESSES = total number of parallel instances of the agent occurring simulataneously.\n"

    "We tuned model hyperparameters in combination for both DDQL (Table 1) and PPO (Table 2). The environment itself was tuned to different stack sizes (2,4,8) and frame skip rates (2,4,8). Evaluation metrics were either logged and graphed manually due to limited compatibility (in the case of DDQL) or visualised using tensorboard (as in PPO). We focussed on average episode losses and average episode rewards as the two most salient indicators of the model’s success in training the agent."

    "Despite attempts to tune parameters, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) results were quite erratic. On the other hand, Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) outperformed PPO, suggesting that it may be more effective for this task. This is likely due to the complex temporal-state-action space in Super Mario, where DDQL’s dual-network architecture helps in more accurately estimating Q-values, leading to better decision-making. Figure 2 compares the base-case to the best parameters we could find for PPO (learning_rate = 0.001, n_step = 512, epsilon = 0.2, gamma = 0.99, tau = 0.95).\n",

    "# 6 - Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our project demonstrates the potential of DDQL in training a game-playing agent and could be replicable in other domains. The key strengths of our solution are rooted in our pre-processing and selection of optimal hyperparameters utilising literature and novel combinations. Firstly, our downscaling of a [3, 240, 256] environment frame to only [1, 84, 84] significantly boosts training time through the computational bottleneck that is a CNN (in DDQL) or PPO algorithm. Additionally, by using multiple CPUs/GPUs to run concurrent training processes and saving models for re-training, we have further boosted its effectiveness. Lastly, the fact that DDQL is relatively new, our proposed model can inspire future studies to improve efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key weakness of our solution is its isolation to World 1.1, as reinforcement learning models themselves are domain-specific and thus must be retrained to different scenarios, unlike other ANNs, which can be pre-trained using different datasets. Additionally, the algorithm is meticulous in implementing and tuning parameters. Ultimately, future work includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training on all 3 worlds of the game.\n",
    "- Using evolutionary methods combined with our solution to take the best of two worlds [12]\n",
    "- Optimising the parameters of DDQL for different worlds or levels within the Super Mario Bros gym environment.\n",
    "- Simplifying the implementation of DDQL (using a library instead, such as stable-baselines-2)\n",
    "- Varying the reward function for different objectives (e.g. a killer Mario whose goal is to kill enemies rather than obtain coins or beat the level quickly)."
